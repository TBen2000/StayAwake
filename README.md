# StayAwake
This repo contains a script that keeps the computer from sleeping and keeps you active on apps like Microsoft Teams. It does so by pressing the F13 key every 6 seconds. The F13 key doesn't exist physically but virtually, so most of the programs shouldn't react to it.

This script does not require any installation or admin rights.
Also, it just runs on Windows machines.

To use it, simply download "stayawake.ps1". Then right click and select "Run with PowerShell".
